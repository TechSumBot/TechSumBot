"Since weak reference can be claimed by garbage collector at any time, is there any practical reason to use it?"The fact that the map itself has a (the only) reference to the object does not stop it from being garbage collected because the reference is a weak reference"A weak reference is a reference that does not protect the referent object from collection by a garbage collector."An object referenced only by weak references is considered unreachable (or "weakly reachable") and so may be collected at any time."Weak references are used to avoid keeping memory referenced by unneeded objects.
