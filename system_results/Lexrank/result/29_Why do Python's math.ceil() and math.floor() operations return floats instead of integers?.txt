"The python functions are wrappers of the C function and so this is really a deficiency of the C functions where they should have returned an integer and forced the programer to do the range/NaN/Inf check before calling ceil/floor.Because the range for floats is greater than that of integers -- returning an integer could overflow"The whole point of ceil/floor operations is to convert floats to integers!"Thus the logical answer is the only time these functions are useful they would return a value within integer range and so the fact they return a float is a mistake and you are very smart for realizing this!"This makes the discussion of integer range versus float range moot because these functions will simply return the original number whenever the number is outside the range of the integer type.
