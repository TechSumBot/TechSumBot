"The python source code is first compiled into [Byte Code (hyper-link)]."Internally the reason that Python code executes more slowly is because code is interpreted at runtime instead of being compiled to native code at compile time."Though Python is an interpreted language, it first gets compiled into byte code."In languages such as C/C++, the source code is compiled into [binary code (hyper-link)] which can be directly executed by the CPU thus making their execution efficient than that of Python.Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code you write must go through many, many stages of abstraction before it can become executable machine code.
