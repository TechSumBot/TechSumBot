"Then this .pyc file(bytecode) is interpreted using CPython interpreter. "Python for example, compile source code to bytcode [usually found as .pyc files accompanying the .py source codes], compile bytocde to machine code [done by a virtual machine such as PVM and the result is an executable file], interpret the machine code/executable for execution. "For example, we could compile a source code to bytcoe, compile bytecode to machine code, interpret machine code for execution."CPython compiles its source code into "byte code", and for performance reasons, it caches this byte code on the file system whenever the source file has changes.They contain [byte code (hyper-link)], which is what the Python interpreter compiles the source to.
