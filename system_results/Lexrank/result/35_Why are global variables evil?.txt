"Having global variables violates the idea of pure functions since an input and maybe one of the outputs (the global variable) is not explicitly being given or returned."If the global variable has been used in that way (i.e the global variable used in function X has to be set in a function Y first) it means that to unit test function X you have to run test/run function Y first."Global variable are considered bad in almost every programming language.This has nothing to do with Python; global variables are bad in any programming language.[Why is Global State so Evil?
