"commit() is synchronously, apply() is asynchronous"apply(): Asynchronous commit(): Synchronous"The difference between commit() and apply()"However, if you previously did implement it and are now getting errors about missing apply(), you can simply call commit() from apply().Unlike commit(), which writes its preferences out to persistent storage synchronously, apply() commits its changes to the in-memory SharedPreferences immediately but starts an asynchronous commit to disk and you won't be notified of any failures.
