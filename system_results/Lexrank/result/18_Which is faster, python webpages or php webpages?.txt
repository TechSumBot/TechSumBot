"The website still is and will be PHP, but we are developing other applications, including web, in Python."Because of this, one could argue that Python has a native advantage over PHP."PHP and Python are similiar enough to not warrent any kind of switching."There's no point in attempting to convince your employer to port from PHP to Python, especially not for an existing system, which is what I think you implied in your question.Since Python is far less ubiquitous than PHP, I wouldn't be surprised if hosting, developer, and other maintenance costs for it (long term) would have it fit this scenario.
