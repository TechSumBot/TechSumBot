"If you don't need access to the attributes or methods of the class or instance, a staticmethod is better than a classmethod or instancemethod."If you want to create a function with behavior that is very closely associated with the class you are creating it for but it doesn't actually access/modify the internal data of an instance of the class in a way that justifies conceptualizing it as a typical method of that class then slap a @staticmethod above it and anyone reading your code will immediately learn a lot about the nature of the method and its relationship to the class."The staticmethod belongs to a class but cannot access or modify any instance or class information."It cannot access attributes or methods of the instance or class.You use either instance methods or class methods.
