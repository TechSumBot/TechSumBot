"Use while True:"Because of the above restriction, the bytecode the two versions compile to is different in Python 2 as there's an optimisation for constant integers that it can't use for True.The first one will work also in those early versions where True is not yet defined."So, while True: is a little easier to read, and while 1: is a bit kinder to old versions of Python."Fundamentally it doesn't matter, such minutiae doesn't really affect whether something is 'pythonic' or not.
