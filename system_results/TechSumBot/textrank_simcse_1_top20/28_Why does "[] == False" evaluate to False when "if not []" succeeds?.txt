See the documentation on [Truth Value Testing (hyper-link)], empty lists are considered false, but this doesn't mean they are equivalent to False.
"If empty containers were literally equal to False, by the way, then any empty container would be equal to any other empty container: for example, {} == "" would be True.
Empty containers are "falsy," that is, they evaluate to False in a Boolean context.
"However, it can evaluate to False--that is to say, its "truthiness" value is False.
"An if statement doesn't depend on whether the value is equal to true.
