These are created by the Python interpreter when a .py file is imported, and they contain the "compiled bytecode" of the imported module/program, the idea being that the "translation" from source code to bytecode (which only needs to be done once) can be skipped on subsequent imports if the .pyc is newer than the corresponding .py file, thus speeding startup a little.
 "The contents of the "spam.pyc" file is platform independent, so a Python module directory can be shared by machines of different architectures.
"When your source file is foo.py , CPython caches the byte code in a foo.pyc file right next to the source.
They contain [byte code (hyper-link)], which is what the Python interpreter compiles the source to.
"In python3, Python's import machinery is extended to write and search for byte code cache files in a single directory inside every Python package directory.
