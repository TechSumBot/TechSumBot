"commit() is synchronously, apply() is asynchronous
"apply() commits without returning a boolean indicating success or failure.
apply() was added in 2.3, it commits without returning a boolean indicating success or failure.
Unlike commit(), which writes its preferences out to persistent storage synchronously, apply() commits its changes to the in-memory SharedPreferences immediately but starts an asynchronous commit to disk and you won't be notified of any failures.
"As SharedPreferences instances are singletons within a process, it's safe to replace any instance of commit() with apply() if you were already ignoring the return value.
