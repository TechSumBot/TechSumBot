In the code you linked to is another additional exception handler:
Since [UnicodeDecodeError (hyper-link)] is a subclass of ValueError, the second exception handler would cause any UnicodeDecodeError to be ignored.
"I am not able to come up with something useful, other than to keep it as a placeholder for later insertion to catch useful exceptions.
It looks like this would not be the intended effect and to avoid it the UnicodeDecodeError is processed explicitly by the first handler.
"I've seen similar code before in a (set of) horrible VB.NET projects.
