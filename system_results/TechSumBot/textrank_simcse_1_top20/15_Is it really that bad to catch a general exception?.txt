"Catching Exception or SystemException means that you will catch problems like IO errors, network errors, out-of-memory errors, missing-code errors, null-pointer-dereferencing and the likes.
"So you should wrap the main body of a thread in a generic try...catch block and pass any exceptions caught there to your global exception handling code.)
"The problem with catching all exceptions is that you may be catching ones that you don't expect, or indeed ones that you should not be catching.
"The first is the one most people are thinking about, putting a try/catch around some operation that requires a checked exception.
My basic rule of thumb is to catch all the exceptions you expect and anything else is a bug.
