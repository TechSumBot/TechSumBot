"The semantics of Thread.yield and Thread.sleep(0) are undefined [JLS17.9]; the JVM is free to implement them as no-ops or treat them as scheduling hints.
"Thread.Sleep(0) might have an optimization to just call yield.
"In particular, they are not required to have the semantics of sleep(0) on Unix systems — put the current thread at the end of the run queue for that priority, yielding to other threads of the same priority — though some JVMs implement yield in this way.
"Thread.Yield can give up CPU resource to threads with lower priorities, while Thread.Sleep(0) gives up CPU only to threads with equal or higher priorities.
Yield adds the current thread to the ready queue and allows other threads to run.
