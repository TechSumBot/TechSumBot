"Data structure memory overhead: A linked list requires at least one pointer for each element it contains.
In computer science, overhead is generally considered any combination of excess or indirect computation time, memory, bandwidth, or other resources that are required to attain a particular goal.
Overhead typically reffers to the amount of extra resources (memory, processor, time, etc.)
This memory allocation takes time, and is not directly related to the work being done, therefore is overhead.
"(Note that the remote server may or may not have any particular memory overhead associated with this task --- it might shove all the values immediately out to storage, for example).
