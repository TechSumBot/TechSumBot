"other interpreted languages such as java bytecode and .net bytecode run faster than python because the standard distributions include a [jit compiler (hyper-link)] that compiles bytecode to native code at runtime.
python is a higher level language than c, which means it abstracts the details of the computer from you - memory management, pointers, etc, and allows you to write programs in a way which is closer to how humans think.
it is true that c code usually runs 10 to 100 times faster than python code if you measure only the execution time.
"compilation vs interpretation isn't important here: python is compiled, and it's a tiny part of the runtime cost for any non-trivial program.
"simply because python is a more high level language and has to do more different things on every iteration (like acquiring locks, resolving variables etc.)
