"final fields do not need to be static, and sometimes it can be useful to have a non-static final instance variable.
immutable objects, for example, have final properties, that can be set only once, by the constructor.

static means that it belongs to the actual class, not an instance of it.
"static final is seen often because it means application1-wide constant.
