"Not an official answer by any means (just a guess based on using the language), but Python allows you to use lists as stacks (e.g., [section 5.1.1 of the tutorial (hyper-link)]).
"Since a pop operation isn't that common in lists (though 'removeLast' could have been used), they defined a pop() but not a push().
"The idea of "pushing" and "popping" are largely independent of how the stack is actually implemented.
"...and I haven't gotten into using linked lists to implement a stack.
"To implement a stack, one would need to add a list.pop() primitive (and no, I'm not against this particular one on the basis of any principle).
