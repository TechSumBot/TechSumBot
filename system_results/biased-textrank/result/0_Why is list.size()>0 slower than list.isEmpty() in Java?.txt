Counting items in a linked list can be very slow.
For other implementations of List — for example, a naïve linked list* — counting the size might take a very long time, while you only actually care whether it is greater than zero.
"A primitive linked list (one that doesn't store the size separately) for example could answer isEmpty() much faster than a size() call.
"In any case, the performance difference between the two will be negligible, especially once you do the comparison you need to do to see if the list is empty (l.size() == 0).
"Take a look at [Java theory and practice: Anatomy of a flawed microbenchmark](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp02225.html) for a general description on how to approach benchmarks.
