The difference between python and C is the usual difference between an interpreted (bytecode) and compiled (to native) language.
Python is a higher level language than C, which means it abstracts the details of the computer from you - memory management, pointers, etc, and allows you to write programs in a way which is closer to how humans think.
CPython is particularly slow because it has no Just in Time optimizer (since it's the reference implementation and chooses simplicity over performance in certain cases).
One thing that will arguably leave Python slower however, is that it's dynamically typed, and there is tons of lookup for each attribute access.
"This compilation and execution are what make Python slower than other low-level languages such as C/C++.
