Because it appends; it doesn't push.
If it was called "push", then it would be unclear whether we're adding stuff at the tail or at head of the list.
Because "append" existed long before "pop" was thought of.
Implicit here is that most people need to append to a list, but many fewer have occasion to treat lists as stacks, which is why list.append came in so much earlier.
The list.pop() method is an alternative to del listobject[index] in that it returns the value at the index you are removing.
