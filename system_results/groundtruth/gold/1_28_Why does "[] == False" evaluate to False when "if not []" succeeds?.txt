The if statement evaluates everything in a Boolean context, it is like there is an implicit call to the [bool() (hyper-link)] built-in function.
See the documentation on [Truth Value Testing (hyper-link)], empty lists are considered false, but this doesn't mean they are equivalent to False.
Empty containers are "falsy," that is, they evaluate to False in a Boolean context.
If empty containers were literally equal to False, by the way, then any empty container would be equal to any other empty container: for example, {} == "" would be True.
"if statement: evaluates to true as long as statement is truthy (an int not equal to '0', True, a list with at least one element, a dict with one key, value pair ..etc).
