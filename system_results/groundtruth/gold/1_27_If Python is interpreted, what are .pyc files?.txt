They contain [byte code (hyper-link)], which is what the Python interpreter compiles the source to.
These are created by the Python interpreter when a .py file is imported, and they contain the "compiled bytecode" of the imported module/program, the idea being that the "translation" from source code to bytecode (which only needs to be done once) can be skipped on subsequent imports if the .pyc is newer than the corresponding .py file, thus speeding startup a little.
The other side of this is, however, that the compilation process is mostly hidden -- the .pyc files are basically treated like a cache; they speed things up, but you normally don't have to be aware of them at all.
In particular, the .pyc files you are seeing are cached bytecode files produced by CPython, Stackless Python or Unladen Swallow.
"Python for example, compile source code to bytcode [usually found as .pyc files accompanying the .py source codes], compile bytocde to machine code [done by a virtual machine such as PVM and the result is an executable file], interpret the machine code/executable for execution.
