Maybe because other languages do this as well, so it is generally-accepted behavior.
Because python's math library is a thin wrapper around the C math library which returns floats.
Because the range for floats is greater than that of integers -- returning an integer could overflow
Before Python 2.4, an integer couldn't hold the full range of truncated real numbers.
"Thus the logical answer is the only time these functions are useful they would return a value within integer range and so the fact they return a float is a mistake and you are very smart for realizing this!
