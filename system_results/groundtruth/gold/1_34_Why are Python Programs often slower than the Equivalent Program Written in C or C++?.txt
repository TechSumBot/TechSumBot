Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code you write must go through many, many stages of abstraction before it can become executable machine code.
The difference between python and C is the usual difference between an interpreted (bytecode) and compiled (to native) language.
Python is a higher level language than C, which means it abstracts the details of the computer from you - memory management, pointers, etc, and allows you to write programs in a way which is closer to how humans think.
Also, pythons dynamic nature makes it impossible to say what type of parameters will be passed to a function, which in turn makes optimizing a whole lot harder.
"In languages such as C/C++, the source code is compiled into [binary code (hyper-link)] which can be directly executed by the CPU thus making their execution efficient than that of Python.
