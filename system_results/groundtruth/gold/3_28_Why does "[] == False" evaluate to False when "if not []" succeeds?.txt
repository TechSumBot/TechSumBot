Empty containers are "falsy," that is, they evaluate to False in a Boolean context.
In your example, the not operator is causing your list to be converted to a boolean.
The empty list, [], is not equal to None.
What happens in your example is that the empty list, taken in boolean context, evaluates to False, the condition fails, so the else branch gets executed.
"if statement: evaluates to true as long as statement is truthy (an int not equal to '0', True, a list with at least one element, a dict with one key, value pair ..etc).
