It has to do with [operator precedence in Python (hyper-link)] (the interpreter thinks you're comparing True to not, since == has a higher precedence than not).
It's just a matter of operator precedence.
The syntax error seems to be caused by the not keyword, not (pun intended) the equality operator:
not has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so not a == b is interpreted as not (a == b), and a == not b is a syntax error.
Basically, the interpreter thinks you're comparing True to not.
