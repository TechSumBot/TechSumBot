apply() was added in 2.3, it commits without returning a boolean indicating success or failure.
Unlike commit(), which writes its preferences out to persistent storage synchronously, apply() commits its changes to the in-memory SharedPreferences immediately but starts an asynchronous commit to disk and you won't be notified of any failures.
"apply() is void function.
"commit() returns true if the new values were successfully written to persistent storage.
"Commit() is instantaneous but performs disk writes.
