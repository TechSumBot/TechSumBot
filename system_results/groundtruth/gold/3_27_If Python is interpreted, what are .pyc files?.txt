".pyc files are compiled Python files written by the Python interpreter.
The other side of this is, however, that the compilation process is mostly hidden -- the .pyc files are basically treated like a cache; they speed things up, but you normally don't have to be aware of them at all.
In particular, the .pyc files you are seeing are cached bytecode files produced by CPython, Stackless Python or Unladen Swallow.
*.pyc file is also generated, as part of running it which performs your import operation on file in shell or in some other file.
"To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled content of modules in .pyc.
