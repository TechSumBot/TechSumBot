An ordered collection maintains the order of the elements based on the sequence you put stuff into/remove them from the collection.
A sorted collection keeps the elements sorted based on a sort criteria.
So the difference is whether the ordering depends on the values ("sorted"), or is a property that elements have independently of their value ("ordered").
"By ordered, it means that each element is assigned an index and can be referenced by that index.
"Ordered doesn't mean sorted, it means that the items will show up in the order you put them in.
