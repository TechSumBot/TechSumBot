This is not a directory as used in file systems, but the standard usage: a listing of names or data.
You're retrieving a "directory", a list of all of the stuff that's available in some resource.
IIRC I named it after the DIR command in DOS.
It gives you an alphabetical listing of valid names (attributes) in the scope (object).
The Python [dir (hyper-link)] function is used to list the objects of the current module of any objects like variables, classes, functionsâ€¦
