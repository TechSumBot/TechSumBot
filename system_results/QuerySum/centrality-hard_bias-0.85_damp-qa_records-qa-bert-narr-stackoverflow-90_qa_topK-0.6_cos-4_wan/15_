My basic rule of thumb is to catch all the exceptions you expect and anything else is a bug.
"By catching an exception and allowing the code execution to continue, you are stating that you know how do deal with and circumvent, or fix a particular problem.
"On the other hand, if you are talking about catching exceptions inside your main() method which catches the exception, displays it and then exits... well, it's probably safe to catch just about any exception here.
"you don't want to catch all exceptions in a library because you may mask problems that have nothing to do with your library, like "OutOfMemoryException" which you really would prefer bubbles up so that the user can be notified, etc.
"So you should wrap the main body of a thread in a generic try...catch block and pass any exceptions caught there to your global exception handling code.)
