"[Why are str.count('') and len(str) giving different output?
"The count() method returns the number of occurrences of a substring in the given string.
"Therefore, if the empty string is a substring of every character, and of the empty string, then count should return the number of characters plus one.
That's because empty strings are considered to exist between all the characters of a string; for a string length 2, there are 3 empty strings; one at the start, one between the two characters, and one at the end.
"It goes on a [loop (hyper-link)], checking for every position if the string matches the sub at that position.
