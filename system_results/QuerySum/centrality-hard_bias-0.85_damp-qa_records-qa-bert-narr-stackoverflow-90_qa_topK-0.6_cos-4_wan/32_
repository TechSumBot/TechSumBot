You use either instance methods or class methods.
static methods are great because you don't have to declare an instance of the object to which the method belongs.
"If you don't need access to the attributes or methods of the class or instance, a staticmethod is better than a classmethod or instancemethod.
"When I want to be explicit about methods that don't change the state of the object, I use static methods.
"If you want to create a function with behavior that is very closely associated with the class you are creating it for but it doesn't actually access/modify the internal data of an instance of the class in a way that justifies conceptualizing it as a typical method of that class then slap a @staticmethod above it and anyone reading your code will immediately learn a lot about the nature of the method and its relationship to the class.
