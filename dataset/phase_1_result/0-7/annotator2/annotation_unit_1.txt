 [1] #1: "commit() returns true if the save works, false otherwise."
 [1] #2: "apply() was added as the Android dev team noticed that almost no one took notice of the return value, so apply is faster as it is asynchronous."

 [0] #3: "From javadoc:"
 [1] #4: "Unlike commit(), which writes its preferences out to persistent storage synchronously, apply() commits its changes to the in-memory SharedPreferences immediately but starts an asynchronous commit to disk and you won't be notified of any failures."
 [1] #5: "If another editor on this SharedPreferences does a regular commit() while a > apply() is still outstanding, the commit() will block until all async commits are completed as well as the commit itself"

 [1] #11: "If you save with apply() and immediately read via any getX-method, the new value will be returned!"

 [1] #16: "As SharedPreferences instances are singletons within a process, it's safe to replace any instance of commit() with apply() if you were already ignoring the return value."
 [0] #17: "The SharedPreferences.Editor interface isn't expected to be implemented directly."
