 [0] #2: "Some possibilities:"
 [1] #3: "For documentation purposes - just to make it explicit which exceptions are expected"
 [1] #4: "As a placeholder for a future (or past) more serious handling before re-raising"

 [0] #5: "In the code you linked to is another additional exception handler:"
         [code snippet]
 [1] #6: "Since [UnicodeDecodeError (hyper-link)] is a subclass of ValueError, the second exception handler would cause any UnicodeDecodeError to be ignored."
 [1] #7: "It looks like this would not be the intended effect and to avoid it the UnicodeDecodeError is processed explicitly by the first handler."
 [0] #8: "So with both handlers together a ValueError is only ignored if it's not a UnicodeDecodeError."

 [1] #9: "The most common use is to propagate some one particular exception and handle all the rest."
 [0] #10: "You can find a lot of examples for propagating KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit (e.g."
 [1] #11: "look at asyncore source): it's convenient for servers to log and continue in case of error in request handler, but you shouldn't catch KeyboardInterrupt to exit on SIGINT."

Answer:  #6 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/3937641)
 [0] #18: "I've seen similar code before in a (set of) horrible VB.NET projects."
 [1] #19: "Either the intent was to catch and log exceptions, without ever coming back to finish the logging, or they heard "you must catch exceptions", implemented this functionality, and someone else decided it should just re-raise."
 [0] #20: "There is no benefit to the above code."

 [0] #21: "Example built on [this question (hyper-link)]."
 [1] #22: "If there's some other except's in the try block, it can be used to filter the exceptions, but alone it's pointless."
         [code snippet]

 [0] #23: "sometimes it useful let me give you a real example that i did i my work :"
 [1] #24: "this was is in a decorator that wrap func : so basically what i have wanted is to re-raise the error that i catched when i called the function func so that the decorator don't change the behavior of the function func, because when func raise an exception the exception are send to the GUI so that an error message can pop up to the user,"
 [0] #25: "and for the try except i use it because i want to execute the code in finally even if an exception is raised"
         [code snippet]
 [0] #26: "hope this will help to understand the use of re-raise"
