When you use the keyword new for example JFrame j = new JFrame(); you are creating an instance of the class JFrame.
When you create an object, you are creating an "instance" of a class, therefore "instantiating" a class.
I think that Object = Instance.
"A class is template for an object and an object is an instance of a class.
"The Object is also called the instance of the class.
