sleep(x) tells the JVM Thread Scheduler to actively put this thread to sleep and not run it again until at least x milliseconds have elapsed.
The most obvious difference is that sleep() throws the (checked) InterruptedException.
Thread.Yield can give up CPU resource to threads with lower priorities, while Thread.Sleep(0) gives up CPU only to threads with equal or higher priorities.
"Thread.yield() will pause the thread and allow other threads to run.
"Thread.Sleep() has a slightly larger overhead because it creates a system that includes some kind of timer that will wake the process.
