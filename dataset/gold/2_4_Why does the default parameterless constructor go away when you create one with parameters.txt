If I've defined a constructor of my own, especially one with parameters, then I most likely have logic of my own that must be executed on creating the class.
If the compiler were to create an empty, parameterless constructor in this case, it would allow someone to skip the logic that I had written, which might lead to my code breaking in all number of ways.
The default, parameterless constructor is added if you don't do anything yourself to take control over object creation.
If you supply no constructor, the compiler will generate a default, zero-argument constructor.
"In this case, the single-argument constructor is supplied by you, so the compiler does not generate a default constructor.
