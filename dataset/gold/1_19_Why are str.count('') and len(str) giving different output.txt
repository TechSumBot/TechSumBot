str.count() counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring:
.count('') counts the number of locations of zero-length strings.
'' doesn't mean any string, it means no string (aka, the empty string, or the 0-length string).
When the search string is the empty string, len(string) + 1 is returned by default.
That's because empty strings are considered to exist between all the characters of a string; for a string length 2, there are 3 empty strings; one at the start, one between the two characters, and one at the end.
