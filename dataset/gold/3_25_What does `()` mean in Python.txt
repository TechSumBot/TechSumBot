It means NOT EQUAL, but it is deprecated, use != instead.
It is an old way of specifying !=, that was removed in Python 3.
() is deprecated and was removed in Python 3, so you should use !=.
The forms () and != are equivalent; for consistency with C, != is preferred; where != is mentioned below () is also accepted.
In Python 2.X, () is same as != but the usage is obsolete and is discouraged in favour of the newer usage which is !=
