It has to do with [operator precedence in Python (hyper-link)] (the interpreter thinks you're comparing True to not, since == has a higher precedence than not).
Have a look in [this table of operator precedences (hyper-link)], you'll find that == binds tigher than not, and thus True == not False is parsed as (True == not) False which is clearly an error.
The true reason for True == not False being a syntax error is that there exists no syntax rule that would produce a [comparison (hyper-link)] therefrom, since
Another thing to remember is that is, not and is not are actually three separate operators.
The syntax error seems to be caused by the not keyword, not (pun intended) the equality operator:
