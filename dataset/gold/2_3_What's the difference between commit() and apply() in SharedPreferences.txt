apply() was added in 2.3, it commits without returning a boolean indicating success or failure.
Unlike commit(), which writes its preferences out to persistent storage synchronously, apply() commits its changes to the in-memory SharedPreferences immediately but starts an asynchronous commit to disk and you won't be notified of any failures.
"It writes the changes to the RAM immediately and waits and writes it to the internal storage(the actual preference file) after.
"commit() returns true if the new values were successfully written to persistent storage.
"apply() is faster.
