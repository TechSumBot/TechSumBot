Since type juggling rules are transitive, passing a numeric string to a function expecting numbers could get you in trouble, especially since almost all arithmetic operators have overloaded operations for strings too.
The problem is that the conversion is ambiguous, because + means both string concatenation and numeric addition.
This behavior is by design, and you should get in the habit of performing explicit type conversions when you need to coerce objects into strings or numbers.
Probably the rationale is that requiring explicit conversions to string reduces the likelihood of unintended behavior (e.g.
"The short answer would be because Python is a strongly typed language.
