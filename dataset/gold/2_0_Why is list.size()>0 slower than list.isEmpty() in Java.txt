For other implementations of List — for example, a naïve linked list* — counting the size might take a very long time, while you only actually care whether it is greater than zero.
A primitive linked list (one that doesn't store the size separately) for example could answer isEmpty() much faster than a size() call.
This is due to class loading, caching, etc.
.size() has to look at the entire list, while .isEmpty() can stop at the first one.
Basically I had found that .size() can be O(1) or O(N), depending on the data structure; .isEmpty() is never O(N).
