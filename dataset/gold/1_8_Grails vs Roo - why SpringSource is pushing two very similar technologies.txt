The main difference is that Roo is a pure Java framework whereas Grails leverages Groovy as well as Java.
The main difference besides using different languages (Groovy vs Java as others mentioned) is that Roo is mainly a development time tool and Grails is more involved in runtime.
"While you can write Groovy code like traditional Java code you still need the Groovy dependencies to run Grails applications.
"We have both technologies because Roo and Grails are very different at philosophical and implementation levels (as already noted in the other replies).
"While these initial differences around language choice and runtime/dev-time operation are immediately apparent, the choice of Grails or Roo also extends to more subtle considerations such as the default technologies used, user interaction model, IDE support, dependencies, standards, roadmap, extensions etc.
