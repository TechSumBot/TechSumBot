Just write a quick test, but bear in mind that each language will be faster with certain functions then the other.
The difference shouldn't be large enough to be the reason to pick one or the other.
PHP and Python are similiar enough to not warrent any kind of switching.
I would assume that PHP (>5.5) is faster and more reliable for complex web applications because it is optimized for website scripting.
For a real benchmark you need two comparable frameworks with hundreds of classes/files an a web application running 100 clients at once.
