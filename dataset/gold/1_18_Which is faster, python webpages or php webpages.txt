Since Python is far less ubiquitous than PHP, I wouldn't be surprised if hosting, developer, and other maintenance costs for it (long term) would have it fit this scenario.
Don't try to compare them by writing your own tiny benchmarks ("hello world") because you will probably not have results that are representative of a real web site generating a more complex page.
PHP and Python are similiar enough to not warrent any kind of switching.
As you know, Python is compiled just-in-time to byte code (.pyc files) when a file is run each time the file changes.
I would assume that PHP (>5.5) is faster and more reliable for complex web applications because it is optimized for website scripting.
