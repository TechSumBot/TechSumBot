None is the "null" of Python, and NoneType is its type.
None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function.
In Python, to represent the absence of a value, you can use the None value types.NoneType.None
It is also a common default return value for functions that search for something and may or may not find it; for example, it's returned by re.search when the regex doesn't match, or dict.get when the key has no entry in the dict.
Python's None object is roughly equivalent to null, nil, etc.
