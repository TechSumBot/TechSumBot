"thread.yield can give up cpu resource to threads with lower priorities, while thread.sleep(0) gives up cpu only to threads with equal or higher priorities.
"openjdk source (java se 7) have the following implementation for thread.sleep(0) in jvm_sleep function of jvm.cpp:
"i'd wager that doing each a million times in a row would take much longer for sleep(), since system timer granularity probably often causes it to actually sleep for a non-negligible amount of time.
"the most obvious difference is that sleep() throws the (checked) interruptedexception.
"thread.sleep() has a slightly larger overhead because it creates a system that includes some kind of timer that will wake the process.
