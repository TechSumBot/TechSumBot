"yes, we can have abstract class without any abstract method.
child classes can use the general methods defined in the abstract class.
if this class extends another abstract class and don't have implementation of inherited abstract methods.
a common reason to do this is to have the abstract class provide exploding implementations of the abstract methods as a convenience to subclasses who don't have to implement all the abstract methods, just those they want to - the remaining ones will still explode but it won't matter if those execution paths aren't exercised.
"when you make a class abstract (either with or without abstract methods), you are forcing the users of this class to create concrete sub-classes of it, since they can't instantiate it.
