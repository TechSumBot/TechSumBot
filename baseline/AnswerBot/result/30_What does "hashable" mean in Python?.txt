"in python, any immutable object (such as an integer, boolean, string, tuple) is hashable, meaning its value does not change during its lifetime.
from the [python glossary (hyper-link)]:
"in my understanding according to python glossary, when you create an instance of objects that are hashable, an unchangeable value is also calculated according to the members or values of the instance.
objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they all compare unequal, and their hash value is their id().
"well, python dictionaries, for example, require the keys to be immutable.
