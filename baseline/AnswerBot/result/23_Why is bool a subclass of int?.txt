"boolean is a subclass of int.
it is perfectly logical, if you were around when the bool type was added to python (sometime around 2.2 or 2.3).
prior to introduction of an actual bool type, 0 and 1 were the official representation for truth value, similar to c89.
"however, inheriting bool from int eases the implementation enormously (in part since all c code that calls pyint_check() will continue to work -- this returns true for subclasses of int).
to avoid unnecessarily breaking non-ideal but working code, the new bool type needed to work just like 0 and 1.
