the most common use is to propagate some one particular exception and handle all the rest.
none at all, that i can think of, except if you're debugging that source code and set a breakpoint on the raise statement.
in the code you linked to is another additional exception handler:
"look at asyncore source): it's convenient for servers to log and continue in case of error in request handler, but you shouldn't catch keyboardinterrupt to exit on sigint.
it looks like this would not be the intended effect and to avoid it the unicodedecodeerror is processed explicitly by the first handler.
