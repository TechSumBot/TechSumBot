list.size 0 slower list.isempty,"even in the best case, size() == 0 is still not faster than isempty(), so there is no compelling reason to ever use the former.
for arraylist, yes — you are correct that the operations take (roughly) the same time.
if things change a few years down the line with code restructuring, testing will show that ""it works,"" but things are running less efficiently than before.
* i originally wrote linkedlist here, implicitly referencing java.util.linkedlist, though that particular implementation does store its size explicitly, making size() an o(1) operation here.
""you could try calling l.size() a couple of million times and l.isempty() a couple of million times in two separate programs but in theory the compiler could just optimize away all those calls since you're not actually doing anything with the results."
