"if you divide int by 0, then jvm will throw arithmetic exception.
the result of division by zero is, mathematically speaking, undefined, which can be expressed with a float/double (as nan - not a number), it isn't, however, wrong in any fundamental sense.
throwing an exception would actually violate that standard.
"in short: floating point numbers can represent infinity (or even operations that yield values which aren't numbers) so an operation that results in this (e.g.
"the division of doubles and floats is as per the [ieee 754 (hyper-link)] standards for floating point match which shouldnt throw an exception.
