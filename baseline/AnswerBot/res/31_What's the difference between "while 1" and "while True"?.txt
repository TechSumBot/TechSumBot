"this helps with the case above because code could do true = 1 for backwards compatibility, but means that the name true needs to be looked up in the globals dictionary every time it is used.
"if you're interested in trivia however, there are some differences.
"because of the above restriction, the bytecode the two versions compile to is different in python 2 as there's an optimisation for constant integers that it can't use for true.
"fundamentally it doesn't matter, such minutiae doesn't really affect whether something is 'pythonic' or not.
"the true and false builtins are [not reserved words prior to python 3 (hyper-link)] so could be assigned to, changing their value.
