"not an official answer by any means (just a guess based on using the language), but python allows you to use lists as stacks (e.g., [section 5.1.1 of the tutorial (hyper-link)]).
"i stil think that all this is best left out of the list object implementation -- if you need a stack, or a queue, with particular semantics, write a little class that uses a lists
"fyi, it's not terribly difficult to make a list that has a push method:
"in other words, for stacks implemented directly as python lists, which already supports fast append(), and del list[-1], it makes sense that list.pop() work by default on the last element.
