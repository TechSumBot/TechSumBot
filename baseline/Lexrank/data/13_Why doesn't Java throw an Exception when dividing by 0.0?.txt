The result of division by zero is, mathematically speaking, undefined, which can be expressed with a float/double (as NaN - not a number), it isn't, however, wrong in any fundamental sense.
As an integer must hold a specific numerical value, an error must be thrown on division by zero when dealing with them.
The way a double is stored is quite different to an int.
See [http://firstclassthoughts.co.uk/java/traps/java_double_traps.html (hyper-link)] for a more detailed explanation on how Java handles double calculations.
You should also read up on Floating Point numbers, in particular the concept of [Not a Number (NaN) (hyper-link)].
If you're interested in learning more about floating point representation, I'd advise reading [this document (hyper-link)] (Word format, sorry).
It delves into the binary representation of numbers, which may be helpful to your understanding.
Java's float and double types, like pretty much any other language out there (and pretty much any hardware FP unit), implement the [IEEE 754 (hyper-link)] standard for floating point math, which mandates division by zero to return a special "infinity" value.
Throwing an exception would actually violate that standard.
Integer arithmetic (implemented as [two's complement (hyper-link)] representation by Java and most other languages and hardware) is different and has no special infinity or NaN values, thus throwing exceptions is a useful behaviour there.
"Though Java developers know about the double primitive type and Double class, while doing floating point arithmetic they don't pay enough attention to Double.INFINITY, NaN, -0.0 and other rules that govern the arithmetic calculations involving them.
"The simple answer to this question is that it will not throw ArithmeticException and return Double.INFINITY.
"Also, note that the comparison x == Double.NaN always evaluates to false, even if x itself is a NaN.
"To test if x is a NaN, one should use the method call Double.isNaN(x) to check if given number is NaN or not.
"This is very close to NULL in SQL.
"It may helpful for you.
"When divided by zero ( 0 or 0.00 )
"If you divide double by 0, JVM will show Infinity.
"public static void main(String [] args){ double a=10.00; System.out.println(a/0); } Console: Infinity
"If you divide int by 0, then JVM will throw Arithmetic Exception.
"public static void main(String [] args){ int a=10; System.out.println(a/0); } Console: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
"But if we divide int by 0.0, then JVM will show Infinity: public static void main(String [] args){ int a=10; System.out.println(a/0.0); } Console: Infinity
"This is because JVM will automatically type cast int to double, so we get infinity instead of ArithmeticException.
