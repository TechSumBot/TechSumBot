When you use the keyword new for example JFrame j = new JFrame(); you are creating an instance of the class JFrame.
The new operator instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory.
Note: The phrase "instantiating a class" means the same thing as "creating an object."
When you create an object, you are creating an "instance" of a class, therefore "instantiating" a class.
Take a look here [Creating Objects (hyper-link)]
The types of the Java programming language are divided into two categories: primitive types and reference types.
The reference types are class types, interface types, and array types.
There is also a special null type.
An object is a dynamically created instance of a class type or a dynamically created array.
The values of a reference type are references to objects.

"Personally I prefer to use the word "instance" when referring to a specific object of a specific type, for example "an instance of type Foo".
