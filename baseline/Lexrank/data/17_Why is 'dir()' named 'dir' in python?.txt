It gives you a directory of all attributes of an object.
This is not a directory as used in file systems, but the standard usage: a listing of names or data.
You're retrieving a "directory", a list of all of the stuff that's available in some resource.
This answer will be most useful to those new to Python.
I am learning Python and just this morning was thinking about the builtin constants and functions that are available in the language.
I find it interesting that you only have to remember three things:
There is a 'special' builtin function dir().
There is a 'system variable' __builtins__.
dir(__builtins__) outputs a view of 'Python's builtin world'.
So what does dir mean?
"I've settled on this for now:
"directions: supplies maps for traversing the Python Landscape.
"See also:
"[dir(): Display a namespace's names (hyper-link)]
"So if you want, you could also let dir stand for
"display inside rubric
"IIRC I named it after the DIR command in DOS.
"It's probably just an analogy to directory listing.
"list() is used for creating a lists, so dir() is used for listing elements object which has a similar tree-like structure to file system.

"It gives you an alphabetical listing of valid names (attributes) in the scope (object).

"Most likely it's a reference to the [DIR (hyper-link)] command of MSDOS.
"DIR does directory listings, like the Unix command ls.
"I know that without arguments, it returns a list of names in the current local scope.

"With arguments, it returns a sorted dictionary keys of all the attributes of that object.
