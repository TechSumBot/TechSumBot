Maybe because other languages do this as well, so it is generally-accepted behavior.
(For good reasons, as shown in the other answers)
Because python's math library is a thin wrapper around the C math library which returns floats.
The range of floating point numbers usually exceeds the range of integers.
By returning a floating point value, the functions can return a sensible value for input values that lie outside the representable range of integers.
Consider: If floor() returned an integer, what should floor(1.0e30) return?
Now, while Python's integers are now arbitrary precision, it wasn't always this way.
The standard library functions are thin wrappers around the equivalent C library functions.
Because the range for floats is greater than that of integers -- returning an integer could overflow
Before Python 2.4, an integer couldn't hold the full range of truncated real numbers.
