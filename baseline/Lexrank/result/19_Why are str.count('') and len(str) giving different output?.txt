"Therefore, if the empty string is a substring of every character, and of the empty string, then count should return the number of characters plus one."The count() method returns the number of occurrences of a substring in the given string."That's because empty strings are considered to exist between all the characters of a string; for a string length 2, there are 3 empty strings; one at the start, one between the two characters, and one at the end.Generally speaking, the empty string will match at all positions in a given string, including right at the start and end, so the count should always be the length plus 1:That's because empty strings are considered to exist between all the characters of a string; for a string length 2, there are 3 empty strings; one at the start, one between the two characters, and one at the end.
