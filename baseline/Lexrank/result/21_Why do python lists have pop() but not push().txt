"However, a list is still first of all a list, so the operations that are common to both use list terms (i.e., append) rather than stack terms (i.e., push)."They did implement push, but they split the functionality into list.insert() and list.append() instead."In other words, for stacks implemented directly as Python lists, which already supports fast append(), and del list[-1], it makes sense that list.pop() work by default on the last element."Push is a defined [stack (hyper-link)] behaviour; if you pushed A on to stack (B,C,D) you would get (A,B,C,D)."To implement a stack, one would need to add a list.pop() primitive (and no, I'm not against this particular one on the basis of any principle).
