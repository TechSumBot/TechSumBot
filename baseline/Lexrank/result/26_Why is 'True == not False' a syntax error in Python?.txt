"Answers claiming that the reason for True == not False constituting a syntax error had to do with operator precedence are mistaken."The syntax error seems to be caused by the not keyword, not (pun intended) the equality operator:"has u_expr following the power operator **, thus allowing - x on the right hand side."The true reason for True == not False being a syntax error is that there exists no syntax rule that would produce a [comparison (hyper-link)] therefrom, sinceIt's just a matter of operator precedence.
