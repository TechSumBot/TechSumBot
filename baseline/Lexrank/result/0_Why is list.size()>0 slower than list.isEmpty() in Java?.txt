"You can't test the speed of calling l.size() and l.isEmpty() at the same time, since they both query the same value."For this class, you'd certainly want to use isEmpty() rather than size() == 0.Even in the best case, size() == 0 is still not faster than isEmpty(), so there is no compelling reason to ever use the former."It might be that some collections just use size()==0 inside their isEmpty() method, but that doesn't mean that they all do."Basically I had found that .size() can be O(1) or O(N), depending on the data structure; .isEmpty() is never O(N).
