"Operations like a division by 0 will give you a double which is NaN."Though Java developers know about the double primitive type and Double class, while doing floating point arithmetic they don't pay enough attention to Double.INFINITY, NaN, -0.0 and other rules that govern the arithmetic calculations involving them."Because the IEEE standard for floating point numbers used has defined values for positive and negative infinity, and the special "not a number" case."Yes, double can represent infinity (as can float), whereas int can't.Java's float and double types, like pretty much any other language out there (and pretty much any hardware FP unit), implement the [IEEE 754 (hyper-link)] standard for floating point math, which mandates division by zero to return a special "infinity" value.
