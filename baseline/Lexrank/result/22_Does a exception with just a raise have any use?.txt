In the code you linked to is another additional exception handler:"Either the intent was to catch and log exceptions, without ever coming back to finish the logging, or they heard "you must catch exceptions", implemented this functionality, and someone else decided it should just re-raise."I am not able to come up with something useful, other than to keep it as a placeholder for later insertion to catch useful exceptions.Since [UnicodeDecodeError (hyper-link)] is a subclass of ValueError, the second exception handler would cause any UnicodeDecodeError to be ignored.It looks like this would not be the intended effect and to avoid it the UnicodeDecodeError is processed explicitly by the first handler.
