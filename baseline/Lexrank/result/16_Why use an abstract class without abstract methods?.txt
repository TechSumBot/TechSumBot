Child classes can use the general methods defined in the abstract class."If we make all of these classes extend a base class with no abstract methods, that then if we wan't all of these classes to have an identical method/feature in the future, that can be done in one shot by putting it in the base class.A common reason to do this is to have the abstract class provide exploding implementations of the abstract methods as a convenience to subclasses who don't have to implement all the abstract methods, just those they want to - the remaining ones will still explode but it won't matter if those execution paths aren't exercised.If this class extends another abstract class and don't have implementation of inherited abstract methods."Abstract class without abstract method means you can create object of that abstract class.
