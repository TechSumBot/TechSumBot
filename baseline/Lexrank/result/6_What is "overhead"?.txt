"If the elements are the same size as a pointer, this means a 50% memory overhead, whereas an array can potentially have 0% overhead."Now, in addition to the memory overhead for our list we're also introducing stack overhead (which is a different sort of memory and is often a more limited resource than other forms of memory)."This shifts our local memory overhead to some other server, and incurs network overhead and external dependencies on our execution."For example we might say that a particular approach might incur considerable CPU overhead while another might incur more memory overhead and yet another might weighted to network overhead (and entail an external dependency, for example)."This approach incurs almost no overhead in terms of CPU, memory or other resources.
