"This compilation and execution are what make Python slower than other low-level languages such as C/C++.
Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code you write must go through many, many stages of abstraction before it can become executable machine code.
It is true that C code usually runs 10 to 100 times faster than Python code if you measure only the execution time.
"The python source code is first compiled into [Byte Code (hyper-link)].
"Other interpreted languages such as Java bytecode and .NET bytecode run faster than Python because the standard distributions include a [JIT compiler (hyper-link)] that compiles bytecode to native code at runtime.
