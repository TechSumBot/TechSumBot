"According to me it also helps in keeping the entire source code consistent rather than half of the folks using isEmpty() and the rest using size()==0.
"For this class, you'd certainly want to use isEmpty() rather than size() == 0.
For other implementations of List — for example, a naïve linked list* — counting the size might take a very long time, while you only actually care whether it is greater than zero.
"Most likely calling l.size() has loaded the size of your list into your cpu cache and calling l.isEmpty() is a lot faster as a result.
