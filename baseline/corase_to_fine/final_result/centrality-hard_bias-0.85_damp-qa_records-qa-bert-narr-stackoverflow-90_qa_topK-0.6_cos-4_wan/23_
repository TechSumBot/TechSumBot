"boolean is a subclass of int.
"This behavior is not guaranteed in Python 2.x, for the simple reason that True and False are not reserved keywords (this change was [introduced in 3.x (hyper-link)]).
"When the bool type was added, it was made a subclass of ints to simplify the use of existing code in new Pythons.
"The main takeaway is that equal objects with the same hash cannot be contained in the same set, and in Python 3.x, 1 and True, and 0 and False, will always have the same hash, and will always be equal.
"False and True are equal to 0 and 1, respectively.
