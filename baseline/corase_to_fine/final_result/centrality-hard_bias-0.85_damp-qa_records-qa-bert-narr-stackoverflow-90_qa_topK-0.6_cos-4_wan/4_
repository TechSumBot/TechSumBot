If I've defined a constructor of my own, especially one with parameters, then I most likely have logic of my own that must be executed on creating the class.
"If you have already defined a constructor, your class is valid, so why should the compiler assume you want a default constructor?
"And now you have to explicitly define a no-arg constructor if you'd like an object to be created either the default way or by passing parameters.
