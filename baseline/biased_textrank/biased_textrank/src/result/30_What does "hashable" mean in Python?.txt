From the [Python glossary (hyper-link)]:
"Let me give you a working example to understand the hashable objects in python.
"In my understanding according to Python glossary, when you create an instance of objects that are hashable, an unchangeable value is also calculated according to the members or values of the instance.
"A hashing function is a function which takes an object, say a string such as “Python,” and returns a fixed-size code.
"This allows Python to create a unique hash value to identify it, which can be used by dictionaries to track unique keys and sets to track unique values.
