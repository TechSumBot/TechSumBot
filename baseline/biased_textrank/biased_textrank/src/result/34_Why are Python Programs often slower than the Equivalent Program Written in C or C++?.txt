The difference between python and C is the usual difference between an interpreted (bytecode) and compiled (to native) language.
However if you also include the development time Python often beats C. For many projects the development time is far more critical than the run time performance.
"Internally the reason that Python code executes more slowly is because code is interpreted at runtime instead of being compiled to native code at compile time.
"One thing that will arguably leave Python slower however, is that it's dynamically typed, and there is tons of lookup for each attribute access.
"This compilation and execution are what make Python slower than other low-level languages such as C/C++.
